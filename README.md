Rural IT Solutions will provide a way for local villagers to beam themselves into the era of IOT. We use IOT technology to measure water quality and combine it with government officials to minimize the output of diseases caused by polluted drinking water. Furthermore, this technology will help people become more knowledgeable about the quality of their drinking water. Local residents affected by bacteria such as H.Pylori will become a thing of the past with the help of big data mined by these IOT devices.

This web-app will display every measurement made by the IOT device on a Google maps marker. Markers that are clsoe to each other will be combined into a cluster to display an average value of that area. The measurements will also be used to be displayed in a Google line chart featuring differnt cities.
